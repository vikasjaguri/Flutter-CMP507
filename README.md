## Hello World Program

This is the simplest Flutter application that displays "Hello World" on the screen. It serves as the foundation for understanding Flutter's basic structure and widget system.

## Navigation Between Two Screens

In this practical, I created a simple app that demonstrates how to navigate between two screens. It showcases Flutter's routing system and how to pass data between screens.

## Text Input Demo

This project allows users to enter text input through a text field. It demonstrates how to handle user input and display it on the screen.

## Working with Images

This practical focuses on displaying images from both local assets and the internet. It covers different ways to work with images in Flutter, including resizing and formatting.

## Working with Audio and Video

In this project, I implemented audio and video playback functionalities using Flutter packages. Users can play, pause, and stop media playback within the app.

## Working with Maps

This practical showcases how to integrate maps into a Flutter application using Google Maps. Users can view their current location and navigate to other places.

## Working with Text Files

In this project, I demonstrated how to read and write text files in Flutter. This practical covers file handling techniques and managing data persistence.

## Working with Shared Preferences

This practical focuses on using Shared Preferences for storing user preferences and small amounts of data locally. It showcases how to persist data across app launches.

## Working with JSON

In this project, I worked with JSON data by fetching, parsing, and displaying it in the app. This practical emphasizes the importance of data formats in mobile development.

## Working with API

In this final practical, I created an application that consumes a public API. Users can view live data from the API and understand how to make network requests in Flutter.
